This project is a compilation of all python notebooks created for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone. 
During this capstone, SpaceX launch data was collected using the SpaceX API and web-scraping SpaceX's Wikapedia Page. 
The data wrangling was used to fill Null  values and adjust the landing outcome to a numeric value to be used for further prediction models.
The data was normalized into a Pandas Data Frame where folow on exploratory data analysis was conducted    
A dashboard was created to allow a user to display success rates based on variables like Payload Mass and Launch Site 
The data was normalized and split into training and test sets to be run through four different calssification models: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Trees. 
Each model performed similarly on the test data, all reaching an output of approximately 83% accuracy.
